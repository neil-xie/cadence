# Restrict GitHub Actions Workflow Changes to Maintainers

GitHub Actions workflow files control CI/CD execution and can be a vector for supply-chain attacks (e.g. exfiltrating secrets, running malicious code on runners). Only repository maintainers should modify them.

## Overview

When evaluating a pull request:

1. **Identify the PR author**
2. **Check if any file under `.github/workflows/` is modified**
3. **Check if the author is a maintainer** (listed in `.github/CODEOWNERS`)
4. **If a non-maintainer modifies workflow files, request removal**

## Detection Logic

### Step 1: Get the list of changed files

Inspect the PR diff for any files matching:
- `.github/workflows/**` (any file inside the workflows directory)

If no workflow files are modified, skip this rule.

### Step 2: Check author against CODEOWNERS

Read `.github/CODEOWNERS` and extract the maintainer usernames from the global `*` ownership line.

If the PR author username is in that list, the change is allowed — skip and approve.

### Step 3: Report when a non-maintainer touches workflow files

When a non-maintainer PR modifies `.github/workflows/`, post a comment asking the contributor to:

1. **Remove the workflow changes from this PR** and resubmit the rest of the change without them, AND
2. **Open a separate issue** describing the workflow change they want made, so a maintainer can implement it in a dedicated PR

Include the list of workflow files that were modified.

## Skip Conditions

The rule is automatically skipped when **ANY** of these is true:

### 1. PR author is a maintainer
- Listed in `.github/CODEOWNERS`

### 2. No workflow files changed
- Diff does not touch `.github/workflows/`

## Example Report

> ⚠️ **Workflow changes require maintainer authorship**
>
> This PR modifies the following GitHub Actions workflow file(s):
> - `.github/workflows/ci-checks.yml`
>
> Changes to `.github/workflows/` can only be made by repository maintainers, since they control CI execution and have access to repo secrets.
>
> **Please:**
> 1. Revert the workflow changes from this PR so the rest can be reviewed.
> 2. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/issues/new) describing the workflow change you'd like, and a maintainer will pick it up in a separate PR.

## Integration Notes

This rule is complementary to other Gitar rules:
- **PR description quality**: Checks content structure
- **Issue linking**: Checks for issue reference
- **Workflow restriction**: Gates a security-sensitive path

All rules run independently; this one only fires when workflow files are touched.
