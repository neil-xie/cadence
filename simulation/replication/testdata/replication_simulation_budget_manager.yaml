# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec for testing the budget manager.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulations can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario budget_manager
#
# Test replication with budget manager enabled
# When workflows are running in a cluster with budget manager
# And a failover occurs
# Then tasks should be cached within budget limits
# And workflows should continue to run and complete in the new cluster
